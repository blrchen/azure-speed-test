        Although the web-based Azure speed test tool is helpful, it cannot measure latency with ICMP ping or TCP ping due to browser
        limitations. To measure ICMP ping latency to Azure datacenters, consider using PsPing from the PsTools suite. This command-line
        utility accurately measures network performance and implements Ping functionality, TCP ping, as well as latency and bandwidth
        measurement.

      <p>To use the PsPing tool for a network latency test, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download PsTools from
          <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx" target="_blank"
            >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896649.aspx</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>Extract the entire package and open a command prompt.</li>
        <li>
          Enter this command: <strong>psping target:port</strong> (replace "target" with an IP address or DNS name of publicly accessible
          virtual machines, storage, SQL databases, or other endpoints).
        </li>
        <li>
          Upon completion, you'll see output displaying latency results in milliseconds (as shown below when using a storage endpoint and
          port 80 as target):

        <li>For a detailed understanding of each PsPing parameter, visit the webpage where you downloaded the tool.</li>
        <li>
          As Azure blocks external ICMP protocol, the general ping.exe using ICMP won't function. However, PsPing can directly test
          connectivity to an unblocked specific TCP port.
        </li>
        <li>
          To test latency between virtual machines in the same VNET or different VNETs across various regions, refer to
