      Azure Speed Test respects your privacy. This page outlines the limited information we collect

    <h2 id="policy-content" class="sr-only">Privacy policy details</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">
      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        We believe in transparency and simplicity. Our approach to data collection is minimal; we
        only gather what's necessary to provide you with the best experience while respecting your
        privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>
        We do not require you to create an account or provide personal details. When you load the
        site, we gather non-identifying analytics such as the pages visited, approximate location
        derived from IP address, browser type, and device characteristics.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you run a latency test, network requests are issued directly from your browser to Azure
        regional endpoints; the results stay in your session and are not persisted on our servers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Cookies &amp; Local Storage</h2>

      <p>
        We use cookies and local storage solely to remember your measurement preferences (selected
        regions, units, and filters). These values remain in your browser and can be cleared at any
        time through your browser settings.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>
        We rely on trusted infrastructure providers to serve static assets and collect anonymous
        usage analytics. These partners process data on our behalf under agreements that safeguard
        your privacy.
      </p>

      <p>We do not sell or share your information for advertising purposes.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Your Choices</h2>
